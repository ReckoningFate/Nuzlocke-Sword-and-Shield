# Pokemon Sword and Shield Nuzlocke Challenge
## Catching Pokemon
* You get one catch attempt per route/zone.
* Each named wild area (17 in total) counts as one zone.
  * You get 1 encounter when you first enter the wild area.
  * You get 2 encounters after each gym challenge.
  * "High Level" impossible to catch pokemon do not count.
* If you fail to catch the pokemon you do NOT get another try on this route.
* Duplicate clause. If you encounter a pokemon you have already caught, then you get to mulligan.
* If you can get through a zone without encountering any pokemon, you can come back later.
* I will allow myself to catch the first Pokemon I see. If I see two at the EXACT same time, I will ignore both and catch the next Pokemon I see.
  * After seeing the first overworld Pokemon, you can decide if you would rather receive a rustling grass Pokemon instead of the overworld one.
* You must nickname your caught pokemon.

## Fainted Pokemon
* If a Pokemon faints it dies. It must be released or boxed indefinitely.
